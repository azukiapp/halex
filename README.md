# Halex

Halex is a tiny library that makes it easier to deal with the
[HAL format](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) in elixir.

In providing tools to build, (de)serialize, and manipulate HAL resources,
Halex has the following goals:

- Provide Elixir Record abstractions
- Clean, small API
- Easily composable, for use in other libraries

Inspired by: [Halibut](https://github.com/locks/halibut)
